# [IoT Based Accsess Mechanism Using InterPlanatery File System](https://pandukonala.github.io/blog-work/ipfs_iot/ipfs_iot.html)
## Overview
> This project is funded by Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The Objective of the project is to use an Interplanetary file system protocol for secure point to point communication between the User and an IoT device, where the device can be operated without any use of a third party vendor.

## Abstract

> In the blooming era of Internet of Things, trust has been accepted as a vital factor
                for provisioning secure, reliable, seamless communications and services.
                However, these IoT devices use various protocols to communicate in which most
                of them follow a centralized architecture for data transfer. Some of these
                protocols are MQTT which has broker for decoupling and transferring data
                between publisher and subscriber. These centralized servers can be third party
                service providers which rises the issue of trust. To address this a decentralized
                and distributed network architecture called IPFS is used instead of third-party
                service providers. IPFS enables publish – subscribe model similar to MQTT but
                by removing the broker and making a peer-to-peer interaction. Peer-to-peer
                architecture has its own challenges like security which can be addressed by
                encrypting the files or data that has to be sent over the IPFS network using PGP
                (Pretty Good Protocol).

## Conclusion
> InterPlanetary File System indeed plays a major role in the field of D2D communication. It is not only keeping the data secure but also guarantees total control of the device which can be accessed from any part of the world due to its distributed architecture. The project presents the use of IPFS in the field of the Internet of things as a communication protocol that solves the problem of data accessibility and availability by scaling out centralized servers and cloud platforms. Which makes it reliable and inexpensive for users, unlike protocols which use brokers. So Future Enhancements’ can be the following: -
                <br>
                • Improvised Filters to prevent various
                <br>
                • Tracker Node to Track Requests (i.e.: - Fire and Forget Service)
                <br>
                • Accessing Multiple Sensors via Same Channel using the above Model in Real Time.
                <br>
                Though the proposed models provide a solution for establishing a secured connection from an end application to an IoT device without depending on third-party service providers by using Peer-to-Peer architecture, it has some limitations.
                <br>
                • It requires more network resources.
                <br>
                • While finding path for the first time between end applications, it requires more
                time as it has to find the shortest path possible in real time.
